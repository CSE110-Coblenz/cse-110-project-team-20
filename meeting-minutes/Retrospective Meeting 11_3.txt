What went well
Splitting up the work i.e. user stories 
Communication on discord
Aimed for 2 meetings a week (one in beginning of week, one at end of week)

What could be improved
Making concrete plans on how to test (need to have things merged)
Plan how to go about code reviews 
Making sure to work in increments and then merge (Merge early to avoid having big big conflicts)
Setting specific tasks or making task list to provide clearer plan for sprints
Breaking down user stories (2, 3, 4) further into much smaller ones to make them more doable to complete in each sprint
Communication on files made
Quality: code reviews, be on same page 

What you will commit to in next sprint
Making sure to set aside the time to work on 
Updating each other on work done
Communication with one another
Continuing work on user story 1, user story 2, user story 3, user story 4
Having parts of game to demo by sprint 2
Need to start merging already
