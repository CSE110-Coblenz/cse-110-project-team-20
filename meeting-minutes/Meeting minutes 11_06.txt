Akshar
* Current Focus: Collaborating with Kinish on User Story 2 (Core Gameplay Loop).
* Progress:
   * Successfully mapped out the logic flow for the game mechanics.
   * Currently integrating the backend logic with the frontend components.
* Plan:
   * Finalize the primary game loop logic.
   * Aiming to have US 2 marked as "Code Complete" before the sprint deadline on Friday.
* Blockers: None currently reported.
Emily
* Current Focus: User Story 1 (Title Screen UI & Assets).
* Progress:
   * Researched and selected a retro-style typography font via Canva; verified licensing for use.
   * Created the initial sprite draft for the "Pixelated Earth" background asset.
* Challenges:
   * Feels the current earth asset lacks depth/polish (appears "amateurish").
* Plan:
   * Iterate on the pixel art design to add shading and rotation frames.
   * Implement the selected font into the CSS/Tailwind configuration.
Joseph
* Current Focus: User Story 3 (ISS Module & Quiz Logic).
* Progress:
   * Drafted the data structure for the International Space Station (ISS) educational quiz.
   * New Feature Proposal: Conceptualized a "Password Mastery" summary screen to display learned credentials/achievements at the end of the level.
* Challenges:
   * Blocker: Encountering dependency conflicts with npm and package.json (version mismatches preventing local build).
* Plan:
   * Troubleshoot node_modules and resolve package lock issues.
   * Refactor existing quiz code to be more modular before adding new features.
Keanu
* Current Focus: Lead on User Story 3 (ISS Level Integration).
* Progress:
   * Completed a working prototype of the ISS level.
   * Demo: Presented a comprehensive walkthrough of the current level flow to the team, demonstrating user navigation and interaction.
* Plan:
   * Incorporate feedback received during the demo.
   * Assist Joseph with the backend integration of the quiz data into the level UI.
* Blockers: None.
Kinish
* Current Focus: User Story 2 (Frontend Visuals).
* Progress:
   * Pair programming with Akshar on the US 2 logic integration.
   * Designing the CSS animations for UI transitions and feedback loops.
* Plan:
   * Polish the entry/exit animations for game elements.
   * Ensure animations are performant and don't cause layout shifts.
* Blockers: None.
Anurag
* Current Focus: User Story 4 (Quality Assurance & Testing).
* Progress:
   * Drafting comprehensive test cases for User Stories 1, 2, and 3.
   * Setting up the testing framework (Jest/Cypress) environment.
* Plan:
   * Begin executing regression tests on completed stories.
   * Goal: Ensure all major bugs are identified before the "Sprint Review."
* Process Improvement:
   * Suggestion: Increase the frequency of sync-ups/mini-standups to ensure frontend and backend integration is seamless before the deadline.
